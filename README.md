# $(whoami)

My code for launching / updating my personal website on AWS S3 static hosting.

I created some modules and a wrapper based around the AWS `boto3` library to automatically create my static website on my AWS account.

Please see [labs.py](labs/labs.py)


#### Info
Here will be my website code someday...


##### Headsup
Remember to set the correct `AWS_PROFILE` env value before running `labs.py`.
